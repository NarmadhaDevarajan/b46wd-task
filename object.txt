window object and document object:
        Window object is the first thing that is loaded in the browser.T window object has all the properties of the window.Whereas document object that will be loaded inside the window object.It also has the properties if document object.By using window object name we can access the data data in the window.By using document object name we can access the data inside the documents. 
        Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objectslike HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags. It is the root element that represents the html document.
        The major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. In the below example window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.
        The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
