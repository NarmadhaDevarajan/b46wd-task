HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2
HTTP1.1 :-
      1. http1.1 loads the operations one after the another. so if one request is not loaded then the other request canaot be loaded until the previos request compkete the oerations.It blocks all the operations until the previous request conplete their work.Because of this it would take time to complete the task.Its the main drawback of this http1.1.
       2. For every TCP connection there is only one request and response. But HTTP/1.1 supports connection reuse.
       3.Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about status of message(24 status code) and its error reporting is quicker and efficient.
       4.It uses digest authentication and NTML authentication	.
       5.It has additional header like cache-control.
       6.Text Based protocol that is in the readable format.
HTTP 2:-
       1.HTTP2 use single TCP connection to handle all request.It can handle multiple request at a time.It doesnt block other request.So it takes quick time to complete the request ans responds.
       2.Security concern from previous version will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However it is better equipped to deal with them.
       3.Does not change much in terms of caching with server push. If the client find resource present already in cache it cancel the push stream.
       4.Uses multiplexing, over a single TCP connection. It is done using streams and it also provide feature called server push.
       5.Headers and status code of HTTP remains same.
       6.It is a binary protocol.
